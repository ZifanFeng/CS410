README
1) An overview of the function of the code (i.e., what it does and what it can be used for).
	Too many reviews to read about a product
Some products has over a thousands reviews

A simple five stars rating cannot reflect reviews on multiple aspects
In terms of clothes, there are different aspect like style, size and textures

Some of the reviews are too long but the reader only needs keyword
Some reviews are over 300 words but only focus on the size of the product



 2) Documentation of how the software is implemented with sufficient detail so that others can have a basic understanding of your code for future extension or any further improvement. 3) Documentation of the usage of the software including either documentation of usages of APIs or detailed instructions on how to install and run a software, whichever is applicable.  4) Brief description of contribution of each team member in case of a multi-person team.  Note that if you are in a team, it is your responsibility to figure out how to contribute to your group project, so you will need to act proactively and in a timely manner if your group coordinator has not assigned a task to you. There will be no opportunity to make up for any task that you failed to accomplish. In general, all the members of a team will get the same grade for the project unless the documentation submission indicates that some member(s) only superficially participated in the project without doing much actual work; in that case, we will discount the grade. Everyone is expected to spend at least 20 hours to seriously work on your course project as a minimum, not including the time spent for preparing the documentation. The 65% of the grade would be distributed as follo
